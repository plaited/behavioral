/*
 * The runtime composition — IN-PROCESS. The engine is behavioral() in the
 * host's main thread: addThread/trigger/step called directly, traces through
 * useTrace with zero postMessage hops (the engine-never-awaits invariant is
 * what makes this safe on the main thread). Frontier is the in-process embed:
 * its analysis dispatch is imported and driven directly, its emit lane bound
 * to the composition's reenter. The capability faculties — shell, store, and
 * security as default processes; system One/Two as endpoint-carrying overrides —
 * are Bun.spawn PROCESSES speaking the unchanged wire over stdio lines —
 * per-space isolatable, abort-able, head-of-line-free — wired by the useFaculty
 * primitive.
 *
 * The in-process re-entry law: addThread alone is inert — every re-entry
 * (satellite results, crash synthesis, thread mounts) pumps one super-step.
 * This was the engine transport's trailing step; it is the composition's
 * now.
 *
 * `faculties` is the allow-list (unset = shell/store/security on); `shell` and
 * `store` are the two default-faculty instance overrides (sandboxed shell,
 * durable store), and `systemOne`/`systemTwo` are endpoint-carrying overrides
 * with no default — all pre-curried useFaculty returns for host-constructed
 * faculties. The composition invokes every factory and owns the resulting
 * process lifecycles, overrides included (the host hands over a factory, not a
 * handle).
 *
 * The lifecycle is explicit: construction wires the engine, faculties, and
 * routes but does NOT flush the deferred thread mounts. The host subscribes
 * (`runtime.useTrace`) first, then calls `runtime.start()` — the boot
 * cascade runs after subscribers attach, so boot traces are observable.
 * `runtime.trigger` admits events only; start/terminate are the host's
 * lifecycle, never the event lane's.
