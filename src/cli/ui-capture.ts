/**
 * The ui autoresearch loop's capture side — the iterate mechanism that
 * refines the ui_* producer threads by measurement, not argument.
 *
 * @remarks
 * An in-process RAW `useTrace` consumer (the eval ruling's canonical path:
 * in-process = raw; the per-consumer catch means it coexists with the
 * redacted trace lane untouched) writing ui-pipeline runs to a capture sink
 * the eval harness reads. A run is LINEAGE-KEYED, never time-windowed: the
 * per-trigger pipeline's minted id (parsed from the mint thread labels,
 * the correlation ids, and the ctx lineage) opens, routes, and closes the
 * run — so interleaved pipelines attribute correctly and unrelated faculty
 * traffic (boot scans, other spaces' requests) stays out of the runs.
 *
 * The Thread set rides `thread_added` for free, in two lanes: the STANDING
 * threads (the policy set) and the run's once-thread RE-ENTRIES (the minted
 * pipeline legs and the transform/faculty result re-entry requesters),
 * position-tagged by the message index at which each arrived. The pump's
 * SUBSCRIBER-ORDER WARP — the composition's pump subscribes first, so a
 * minted set (and its scale-check selection) reaches this consumer BEFORE
 * the opening render-ingress selection trace — is handled by binding runs
 * lazily: the pipeline id arrives with the mint (or the first id-bearing
 * message), the ingress trace is inserted at message 0 whenever it binds.
 *
 * The replay pass is `frontier_request { op: 'replay' }` over a captured
 * run — the divergence view: where requests blocked, what the frontier
 * looked like when the hold happened. Replay the full run for the end
 * state; replay a PREFIX (`uiReplayRequest(run, upTo)` — the message count,
 * e.g. up to just before the browser's scale reply) for the hold. The
 * graders are consumer-authored (the eval data-contract) — this module
 * wires the loop, nothing more.
 *
 * MINIMAL: a run closes ONLY at its `ui_render` terminus (the id-joined
 * draft) — a held run (no browser reply) stays open forever; the
 * quiescence-based flush of incomplete runs rides a named need.
