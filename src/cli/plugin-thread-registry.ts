/**
 * The plugin-thread admission registry — the durable record of admission
 * decisions, host-local under `<home>` (the config.ts/traces pattern —
 * never the space-scoped store).
 *
 * @remarks
 * Keyed (plugin, file, content hash, space): an `admitted` entry carries
 * the validated thread SNAPSHOT — threads are pure data, so a boot mounts
 * straight from the snapshot and never re-imports the plugin file for an
 * unchanged admission. A `rejected` entry carries the reason and stays out,
 * visible in traces. Hash keying means a plugin update re-arms the proposal:
 * new thread code is never silently admitted. Re-proposal triggers are
 * exactly the key's dimensions — a new file, a changed hash, or a new
 * target space; root and a named space hold independent entries for the
 * same thread.
 *
 * The file is an external boundary (user-editable, crash-persisted), so the
 * whole registry validates against the AJV schema on read — the thread leg
 * derives from the engine's own `ThreadSchema` home, never hand-mirrored —
 * and a malformed file fails fast with its path (the load-config pattern),
 * never silently ignored. Writes are synchronous by design: the
 * composition's trace-listener outcome legs fire-and-forget, so an async
 * writer could reorder or drop the last admission on exit (the trace-log
 * sink's rule).
 *
