/**
 * The rpc auth seam's threads — the vend-and-replay spine that wires the
 * shell faculty's `rpc` op to the security faculty's credential vending.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The declarative flow: an `rpc` op declared `auth: true` short-circuits (in
 * the shell faculty) as a typed `credential_required` result echoing the
 * originating request — the capture payload. These threads complete the
 * round-trip:
 *
 * 1. **requestor** — a `credential_required` result (first attempt only: a
 *    replayed call already carries `authToken`) transforms into a
 *    `credential_request { serverUrl }` with the original call riding
 *    `ctx.echo` — the out-of-band lane (the you.com MCP pattern: host-supplied
 *    data rides `detail.ctx` beside `input`, never as a model-facing field).
 * 2. **replayer** — the vended `credential_result` (token + echoed ctx)
 *    replays the original `shell_request` with the bearer merged into the
 *    input. The security faculty never talks to shell directly; this thread
 *    is the only join.
 *
 * The absent-credential branch is deliberately inert: the caller already
 * holds the terminal `credential_required` error, and a replay has nothing
 * to join on — the failed vend is visible as an unmatched `credential_result`
 * in the frontier traces. MINIMAL: no retry/backoff policy here; the generic
 * retry thread pattern covers it when needed.
 *
 * Requires shell + security — bProgram mounts it only when both are on.
