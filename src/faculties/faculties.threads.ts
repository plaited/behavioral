/**
 * The composition's root thread pack — the default threads, always mounted
 * (independent of the faculty allow-list) — plus the guard generator every
 * mounted faculty reuses.
 *
 * @remarks
 * A guard thread `block`s every message whose `detail` does not conform to its
 * schema (`detailMatch: false` matches non-conforming details). A blocked
 * message is never selected, so the rejection is visible in the
 * `frontier`/`pending_bids` traces; valid messages pass untouched. A block-only
 * thread stays pending forever (nothing resumes it), so its block declaration
 * is active every super-step.
 *
 * `guardThreads` is the one generator: the controller vocabulary
 * (`ui_render`/`ui_event`/…) and every mounted faculty's request/cancel/result
 * events derive their guard rules from the same schema homes that `useFaculty`
 * compiles — validation lives in threads, and no hand-maintained guard list
 * can drift from the wire contract.
